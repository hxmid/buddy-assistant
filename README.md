# buddy-assistant
stupid assistant that i made with python
has some small functions that i will probably never use
its also pretty slow because it sends the incoming audio to google to interpret, you could porbably make it more efficient by just interpreting it locally but im braindead and have no idea how to train an AI to notice differences in pitch and generally speaking google's one is pretty effective.
